**Who am I?**  
>Galaad Bastos.  
Used to be an archaeologist. Actually, an archaeometrist, but most people don't even know that word.  
Archaeometrists support archaeology by bridging archaeology and experimental sciences like chemistry, physics, geology, biology, etc.  
I worked in this field for several years as an academic researcher, providing complex chemical analyses, building associated databases, and helping interpret the chemical results. Not so much like Indiana Jones after all.
    
**I’m currently**  
> Learning a lot about observability as a Business Support Analyst at Dynatrace.  
> Improving my data analysis skills with the most commonly used tools in this domain (Python, SQL, Power BI, Excel/Sheets, etc.).  
> Please check the app we developed as our final project during the Le Wagon Bootcamp :  [Projet QV](https://projet-qv.streamlit.app)  
  
**I’m looking to collaborate on**  
>   \- any open-source project using data for the common good ;  
    \- any engaging project realated to my favorite hobbies: cooking, DIY, history, sports, chess, hiking, D'n'D, strategy games, politics, etc.
